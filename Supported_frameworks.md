# Supported frameworks

The following is a list of frameworks that we have actively tested and are supported. Other frameworks may work out of the box. If not, feel free to open an issue on this repo.

- [Next.js](https://stackblitz.com/fork/nextjs)
- [NestJS](https://stackblitz.com/fork/nestjs-starter)
- [NuxtJS](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxtjs)

## Add support for a framework

Since our technology allows you to run node programs in the secure context of your browser, it could be that the framework you want to use “just works”. If you want to try it out, follow these steps:

1. Go to <a href="https://stackblitz.com/fork/node" target="_blank">our node starter</a>
2. Add a dependency to the framework you wanna try out by using `npm i ${framework}`
3. Add the necessary files to the stackblitz example.
4. See if it works!

If it works, great! Feel free to open a PR modifying this page, and give us the URL of your test project. We will verify if everything works after that.

If it doesn't work, you can file an issue by clicking the button in the editor or by creating an issue on this repo and we will try and figure out what went wrong.

In both cases: Thanks for helping us!
